Longest subarray not having more than K distinct elements.

Given N elements and a number K, find the longest subarray which has not more than K distinct elements.(It can have less than K).

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            k = 6
Output : 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: The whole array has only 5
distinct elements which is less than k,
so we print the array itself.

Input: arr[] = {6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5}
           k = 3
Output: 1 2 3 2 1,
The output is the longest subarray with 3
distinct elements.
